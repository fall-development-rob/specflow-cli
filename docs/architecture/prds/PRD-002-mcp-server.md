# PRD-002: Specflow MCP Server

**Status:** Proposed
**Author:** Specflow Team
**Phase:** 3
**Priority:** High
**Depends on:** PRD-001 (CLI Rewrite)

---

## Problem Statement

Claude Code has no awareness of Specflow contracts. Enforcement happens reactively through hooks — after code is written, a hook detects the change and runs tests. This means violations are caught late: code is written, hook fires, test fails, code gets rewritten.

An MCP server makes Claude Code **proactively contract-aware**. Before writing code, Claude can check "would this violate any contracts?" and avoid the violation entirely. This is the difference between a speed bump and a guardrail.

## Goals

1. Expose Specflow's contract engine as MCP tools callable by Claude Code
2. Enable proactive contract checking before code is written
3. Support `claude mcp add specflow -- specflow mcp start` registration
4. Zero configuration beyond registration — auto-discovers contracts in the project

## Non-Goals

- Web-based MCP transport (stdio only for v1.0)
- Real-time contract file watching (future)
- Multi-project support in one server instance
- Authentication or access control

{
  "contracts_generated": 3,
  "test_stubs_generated": 3,
  "files": [
    "docs/contracts/journey_login.yml",
    "tests/e2e/journey_login.spec.ts"
  ]
}
```

### `specflow_verify_graph`

**Description:** Run contract graph integrity checks.

**Input:** `{ "dir": "string (optional)" }`

**Output:**

## Technical Design

### Protocol

- Transport: stdio (stdin/stdout)
- Protocol: JSON-RPC 2.0 (MCP specification)
- Logging: stderr only (stdout reserved for protocol)

### Mode Detection

In `bin/specflow.js`:
```
if (!process.stdin.isTTY && (no args OR args[0] === 'mcp')) {
  → start MCP server
} else {
  → start CLI
}
```

### Server Lifecycle

1. Read JSON-RPC messages from stdin (newline-delimited)
2. Handle `initialize` → return capabilities and tool list
3. Handle `tools/list` → return 8 tool definitions
4. Handle `tools/call` → execute tool, return result
5. Handle `ping` → return pong
6. On stdin close → exit cleanly

### Contract Engine Reuse

The MCP server uses the same `src/contracts/loader.js` and `src/contracts/scanner.js` as the CLI `enforce` command. No duplication.

---

## Registration UX

```bash
# Register with Claude Code
specflow mcp register

# This runs:
# claude mcp add specflow -- specflow mcp start

# Or manually:
claude mcp add specflow -- npx @robotixai/specflow-cli mcp start

# Unregister
specflow mcp unregister
```

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `specflow mcp start` starts a stdio MCP server
- [ ] `claude mcp add specflow -- specflow mcp start` registers successfully
- [ ] All 8 MCP tools return correct results
- [ ] `specflow_check_code` catches violations the contract tests catch
- [ ] Server exits cleanly when stdin closes
- [ ] All output goes to stderr (stdout is protocol-only)
- [ ] Works with Claude Code's MCP protocol version

## Simulation Findings (2026-04-04)

### SIM-MCP-001 (CRITICAL): `check_code` tool returns 0 rules checked

**File:** `ts-src/mcp/tools.ts` — `handleCheckCode` function
**Severity:** CRITICAL — This is the most dangerous bug in the system. The MCP tool that should prevent contract violations is non-functional.

**Problem:** The `specflow_check_code` MCP tool calls `checkSnippet()` but always returns `rules_checked: 0` and `clean: true`, regardless of the code content. The `checkSnippet` function is not loading contracts, not compiling patterns, and returning empty violation arrays.

This means Claude Code, when using the MCP server for proactive contract checking, believes all code is clean. The entire proactive enforcement layer (the "guardrail" described in this PRD's Problem Statement) is silently disabled.

**Expected behavior:** `checkSnippet("const password = 'hunter2'", contracts)` should return a SEC-001 violation.

**Actual behavior:** Returns `{ clean: true, violations: [], rules_checked: 0 }`.

**Root cause:** `checkSnippet` must:
1. Load all contracts from the project's contract directory
2. Compile all regex patterns
3. Scan the provided code string against ALL rules
4. Since snippet checking has no file path for scope matching, all rules should apply (or use the optional `file_path` parameter for scope filtering when provided)

**Fix specification:**
```
checkSnippet(code: string, contracts: Contract[], filePath?: string) → Violation[]

1. If filePath is provided:
   - Filter rules to those whose scope matches filePath
2. If filePath is NOT provided:
   - Apply ALL rules regardless of scope (conservative: check everything)
3. For each applicable rule:
   - Run all forbidden_patterns against the code string
   - Run all required_patterns against the code string
   - Generate Violations for any matches/misses
4. Return the full violation list
```

**Impact if not fixed:** Every Claude Code user with the MCP server registered gets zero contract enforcement during proactive checks. Violations are only caught reactively by hooks (which also have issues — see DDD-002 simulation findings).
