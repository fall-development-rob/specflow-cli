# Spec Format – From Vibes to Contracts

Write specs in a **minimal structure** so LLMs can reliably turn them into contracts.

---

## Why This Format?

**Problem:** You write prose specs → LLM guesses at meaning → contracts miss critical details

**Solution:** Constrained format with IDs → LLM parses deterministically → contracts map 1:1 to requirements

---

## 1. File Layout

Each feature gets its own spec file under `docs/specs/`, e.g.:

```
docs/specs/
├── authentication.md
├── email-service.md
├── payment-processing.md
└── user-profile.md
```

**One feature per file.** Don't create god-specs.

---

## 2. Section Layout

Each spec file uses the same structure:

```markdown
# Feature: [Feature Name]

## ARCHITECTURE (Define First!)

### ARCH-001 (MUST)
[Structural constraint that all features must respect]

## REQS

### [REQ-ID] (MUST)
[Requirement description]

### [REQ-ID] (SHOULD)
[Preferred behavior, not enforced]

## INVARIANTS

- [Invariant that must remain true across refactors]
- [Permission/security/identity invariant]

## Persona Simulation

### Persona: [name]
Job to be done:
- [what they are actually trying to achieve]

Simulation:
1. [step]
2. [step]
3. [step]

Breakpoints:
- [where it becomes harder, ambiguous, or unsafe]
- [missing prerequisite or trust break]

Outcome:
- [does this feature help this persona or not]

## Simulation Verdict
- [overall conclusion]
- [what must be true for the feature to work]
- [highest-risk edge]
- [what should be implemented first]

---

## JOURNEYS

### [JOURNEY-ID]
[User journey description]

## TESTS

### Feature
- [path/to/feature.test.ts]

### Contract
- [path/to/contract.test.ts]

### Security
- [path/to/security.test.ts]

### Playwright
- [path/to/journey.spec.ts]
- or: `N/A — no direct UI surface`

## Journey Contract

[Journey contract reference]

## Pre-flight Findings

> This section is machine-readable. Formatting must be exact.
> It is appended by specflow-writer after pre-flight runs — do NOT author it manually.
> waves-controller parses `simulation_status` directly: no regex, no interpretation.
> Any value outside the enum is treated as `blocked`.
> `confidence_score` is NOT in this section (deferred from v1 — see SIM-012).

**simulation_status:** [passed | passed_with_warnings | blocked | stale | override:reason]
**simulated_at:** [ISO timestamp — RFC 3339 UTC, e.g. 2026-02-19T14:32:00Z]
**scope:** [ticket | wave]

### CRITICAL
<!-- Empty if none -->

### P1
<!-- Empty if none -->

### P2
<!-- Logged to docs/preflight/[ticket-id]-[timestamp].md -->
```

### Compliance Rules

Specflow compliance is not satisfied by headings alone.

A spec is only compliant when it includes:
- `REQS`
- `INVARIANTS`
- `Persona Simulation`
- `JOURNEYS`
- `TESTS`
- `DEFINITION OF DONE` or equivalent release gate

Additional rules:
- Every `MUST` requirement must map to at least one test.
- Persona simulation is required for UI, workflow, permissions/auth, automation/agent, and multi-actor features. Tiny mechanical tickets may use `N/A` only with explicit justification.
- Persona simulation must cover at least:
  - the primary user
  - one edge, secondary, hostile, unauthorized, or operator persona as relevant
- Persona simulation must end in structured breakpoints and pre-flight findings. Narrative alone is insufficient.
- Every ticket/spec must state whether there is a direct UI surface.
- If there is a direct UI surface, include a Playwright journey or explain why it is intentionally absent.
- Docs/discoverability work is not exempt. If a user or developer must find it, there must be a discoverability surface or an explicit statement that it is repo-only.
- Feature tests and contract tests are different. Use both when behavior and published interface both matter.

### Persona Simulation Prompt

Use this prompt before locking the ticket/spec:

```text
Run a pre-flight simulation on this ticket before implementation.

You are not writing marketing copy. You are trying to find where the feature breaks, adds friction, leaks permissions, or fails the user’s real job to be done.

1. Identify the 2-4 most relevant personas for this feature.
   Include:
   - the primary user
   - a secondary or edge user
   - a hostile, unauthorized, or mis-scoped user if permissions matter
   - an operator/debugger persona if observability matters

2. For each persona, simulate the end-to-end experience step by step.
   Focus on:
   - what they are trying to achieve
   - what they see or do
   - where the workflow becomes harder
   - where the model is ambiguous
   - where permissions or data boundaries may break
   - what prerequisite is missing
   - what would make them stop trusting the feature

3. Separate:
   - UI friction
   - workflow friction
   - data/model problems
   - security/permission risks
   - observability/debugging gaps

4. Conclude with:
   - Does this feature actually accomplish the job?
   - What must be true for it to work well?
   - What is the highest-risk edge?
   - What should be implemented first?

5. Output in this exact structure:

## Persona Simulation

### Persona: [name]
Job to be done:
- ...

Simulation:
1. ...
2. ...
3. ...

Breakpoints:
- ...
- ...

Outcome:
- ...

## Simulation Verdict
- ...

## Pre-flight Findings

**simulation_status:** passed | passed_with_warnings | blocked
**simulated_at:** [ISO UTC timestamp]
**scope:** ticket

### CRITICAL
- ...

### P1
- ...

### P2
- ...
```

### Persona Simulation Anti-Patterns

- Do not write only happy-path simulation.
- Do not produce persona theater with no concrete breakpoints.
- Do not confuse evidence of activity with success at the job to be done.
- Do not use one persona when the feature clearly has multiple actors or roles.
- Do not stop at UI polish; include permissions, data model, and trust edges.
- Do not let simulation replace requirements. Use it to sharpen them.
- Do not mark `simulation_status: passed` if a critical prerequisite is missing.

## 3. Architecture Requirements (ARCH-xxx) - DEFINE FIRST

**Architecture requirements are foundational invariants that constrain HOW all features are built.**

Before writing feature requirements, define your architecture constraints. These are structural decisions that:
- Cannot be violated by any feature
- Protect against "optimizations" that break the system
- Survive across feature iterations

### Why Architecture First?

Without explicit architecture contracts:
1. LLM "optimizes" your auth flow and breaks security
2. Someone adds localStorage to a service worker
3. API calls start happening from UI components
4. The codebase drifts into chaos

**Architecture contracts prevent structural drift.**

### How to Generate Architecture Invariants

Ask your LLM:

```
I'm building [describe your app].

Generate architecture invariants (ARCH-xxx requirements) that will:
1. Enforce package/module boundaries
2. Isolate secrets and sensitive operations
3. Define where API calls can happen
4. Set size/complexity limits
5. Ensure platform compatibility (e.g., no localStorage in service workers)

Format as ARCH-001 (MUST), ARCH-002 (MUST), etc.
Include enforcement criteria for each.
```

### Architecture Requirement Format

```markdown
### ARCH-001 (MUST)
[Package/layer] MUST [constraint].

Enforcement:
- [What pattern must NOT appear in code]
- [What pattern MUST appear in code]
- [File scope where this applies]

Rationale:
- [Why this constraint exists]
```

### Common Architecture Invariants

**Package Layering:**
```markdown
### ARCH-001 (MUST)
Core package MUST be pure TypeScript with no browser/platform APIs.

Enforcement:
- `packages/core/` must not import `chrome.*`, `browser.*`, `window.*`, or `localStorage`
- Platform-specific code goes in `packages/extension/` or `packages/cli/`

Rationale:
- Core logic can be tested without browser
- Core can be reused across platforms
```

**API Isolation:**
```markdown
### ARCH-002 (MUST)
External API calls MUST only happen from background/server layer.

Enforcement:
- UI components and content scripts must not contain `fetch()` to external domains
- Use message passing to delegate API calls to background

Rationale:
- Secrets stay in background
- Rate limiting in one place
- Easier to mock for testing
```

**Size Limits:**
```markdown
### ARCH-003 (MUST)
Files MUST be under 200 lines. Functions MUST be under 80 lines.

Enforcement:
- Automated line count check in CI
- Refactor into helpers when approaching limits

Rationale:
- LLMs work better with smaller files
- Easier to review and maintain
```

**Platform Compatibility:**
```markdown
### ARCH-004 (MUST)
Service workers MUST NOT use localStorage or sessionStorage.

Enforcement:
- `src/background/**` must not contain `localStorage` or `sessionStorage`
- Use `chrome.storage.local` instead

Rationale:
- localStorage not available in MV3 service workers
- Prevents runtime errors
```

### Architecture Contract Generation

Architecture requirements become `feature_architecture.yml`:

```yaml
contract_meta:
  id: feature_architecture
  covers_reqs:
    - ARCH-001
    - ARCH-002
    - ARCH-003

rules:
  non_negotiable:
    - id: ARCH-001
      title: "Core package must be pure TypeScript"
      scope:
        - "packages/core/**/*.ts"
      behavior:
        forbidden_patterns:
          - pattern: /chrome\./
            message: "Browser APIs not allowed in core (ARCH-001)"
          - pattern: /localStorage/
            message: "localStorage not allowed in core (ARCH-001)"
```

---

## 4. Feature REQS Section

Feature requirements define **what** the product does. Architecture requirements define **how** it's built.

### Format:

```markdown
### AUTH-001 (MUST)
All API endpoints (except /health and /public/*) MUST require authentication.

### AUTH-002 (MUST)
Auth tokens MUST be stored in httpOnly cookies, never in localStorage or sessionStorage.

### AUTH-003 (MUST)
Sessions MUST expire after 7 days.

### AUTH-010 (SHOULD)
Session timeout SHOULD be configurable per environment.
```

### Rules:

1. **IDs are unique across project**: `AUTH-001`, `EMAIL-001`, `PAY-001`
   - Format: `[FEATURE]-[NUMBER]`
   - Numbers 001-009 for critical MUST requirements
   - Numbers 010+ for SHOULD requirements
   - **Leave gaps for iteration**: Use 001-006 for V1, leave 007-019 empty, use 020+ for V2

2. **Tags are explicit**: `(MUST)` or `(SHOULD)`
   - `(MUST)` → Becomes `non_negotiable` rule in contract
   - `(SHOULD)` → Becomes `soft` rule in contract

3. **One requirement per ID**: Don't mix multiple rules in one REQ

4. **Be specific**: "Auth tokens in httpOnly cookies" not "Tokens should be secure"

### ID Gap Strategy for Iteration

When building iteratively, leave gaps in REQ IDs:

```markdown
## V1 Requirements
### AUTH-001 (MUST) - Core login
### AUTH-002 (MUST) - Core logout
### AUTH-003 (MUST) - Session management
### AUTH-004 to AUTH-019 - [RESERVED FOR V1 ADDITIONS]

## V2 Requirements (added later)
### AUTH-020 (MUST) - OAuth support
### AUTH-021 (MUST) - 2FA
```

**Why gaps?** New requirements added during iteration get IDs that group logically with their version, making the spec readable and the changelog clear.

---

## 5. JOURNEYS Section

### Format:

```markdown
### J-AUTH-REGISTER

User registration:
1. User visits /register
2. User fills email + password
3. User submits the form
4. System sends confirmation email
5. User clicks confirmation link
6. User lands on /dashboard

### J-AUTH-LOGIN

User login:
1. Visit /login
2. Submit valid credentials
3. Get redirected to /dashboard
```

### Rules:

1. **Journey IDs**: `J-[FEATURE]-[NAME]` (e.g. `J-AUTH-REGISTER`)

2. **Numbered steps**: Clear 1, 2, 3 sequence

3. **Observable actions**: Things you can test (navigation, form submission, API calls)

4. **Expected outcomes**: What should happen at each step

### Preconditions:

**Extract preconditions from the user's language.** When users describe a journey, they often embed required state:

| User Says | Precondition to Extract |
|-----------|------------------------|
| "cancel a **pending** order" | `pending order exists` |
| "edit **their own** profile" | `user is logged in` |
| "view **other** user's posts" | `multiple users with posts exist` |
| "checkout with **items in cart**" | `cart has items` |
| "approve a **submitted** request" | `submitted request exists` |

**Format with preconditions:**

```markdown
### J-ORDER-CANCEL

Preconditions:
- User has at least one pending order

Steps:
1. User opens orders page
2. User sees pending order
3. User clicks cancel button
4. User confirms cancellation
5. Order status changes to cancelled
```

**Why this matters:** Tests generated from journeys need setup code. Explicit preconditions tell the LLM what state to create before running the journey steps.

### List Contexts:

When a step involves selecting from multiple items, mark with `[LIST]`:

```markdown
### J-ORDER-HISTORY

Steps:
1. User opens orders page
2. User sees [LIST] past orders       ← signals multiple items
3. User clicks on one order
4. User sees order details
```

**Why this matters:** `[LIST]` tells the LLM to generate scoped locators:

```javascript
// Without [LIST] hint - FAILS with strict mode violation
await page.locator('[data-testid="order-item"]').click();  // matches multiple!

// With [LIST] hint - LLM generates scoped locators
const orderItem = page.locator('[data-testid="order-item"]').first();
await orderItem.locator('[data-testid="view-button"]').click();
```

---

## 6. DEFINITION OF DONE (DOD)

Journeys serve as your **Definition of Done**. A feature isn't complete when code is written—it's complete when users can accomplish their goals.

### Format:

```markdown
## DEFINITION OF DONE

### Critical (MUST PASS)
- J-AUTH-REGISTER
- J-AUTH-LOGIN

### Important (SHOULD PASS)
- J-AUTH-PASSWORD-RESET

### Future (NOT BLOCKING)
- J-AUTH-2FA
```

### Criticality Levels:

| Level | Meaning | Release Gate |
|-------|---------|--------------|
| `Critical` | Core user flows | ❌ Cannot release if failing |
| `Important` | Key features | ⚠️ Should fix before release |
| `Future` | Planned features | ✅ Can release without |

### Rules:

1. **Every Critical journey must have**:
   - A journey contract (`journey_*.yml`)
   - An E2E test file
   - Passing status before release

2. **DOD answers**: "When is this feature done?"
   - Unit tests pass? Not enough.
   - Integration tests pass? Getting closer.
   - **Critical journeys pass? NOW it's done.**

3. **Journey status tracking**:
   - `passing` - E2E tests green
   - `failing` - E2E tests red (blocks release if Critical)
   - `not_tested` - No E2E test yet (blocks release if Critical)

---

## 7. Complete Example

```markdown
# Feature: User Authentication

## REQS

### AUTH-001 (MUST)
All API endpoints (except /health and /public/*) MUST require authentication.

Enforcement:
- Every route under /api/* must have authMiddleware
- No bypass flags or environment variables

### AUTH-002 (MUST)
Auth tokens MUST be stored in httpOnly cookies, never in localStorage or sessionStorage.

Rationale:
- localStorage vulnerable to XSS attacks
- httpOnly cookies inaccessible to JavaScript

### AUTH-003 (MUST)
Sessions MUST expire after 7 days.

Implementation:
- Set maxAge: 7 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000
- No "remember me" option that extends this

### AUTH-004 (MUST)
Passwords MUST be hashed with bcrypt (min 10 rounds) before storage.

Enforcement:
- Never store plaintext passwords
- Use bcrypt.hash(password, 10) or higher

### AUTH-010 (SHOULD)
Session timeout SHOULD be configurable per environment.

Rationale:
- Dev environments may want longer sessions
- Production should default to 7 days

---

## JOURNEYS

### J-AUTH-REGISTER

User registration:
1. User visits /register
2. User fills email + password form
3. User submits the form
4. System validates email format
5. System hashes password (AUTH-004)
6. System creates user record
7. System sends confirmation email
8. User clicks link in email
9. System marks email as confirmed
10. User lands on /dashboard

### J-AUTH-LOGIN

User login:
1. User visits /login
2. User enters email + password
3. User submits form
4. System validates credentials
5. System creates session with httpOnly cookie (AUTH-002)
6. System redirects to /dashboard
7. User sees authenticated dashboard

### J-AUTH-LOGOUT

Preconditions:
- User is logged in with active session

Steps:
1. User clicks logout button
2. System clears session cookie
3. System redirects to /login
4. User cannot access protected routes

---

## DEFINITION OF DONE

### Critical (MUST PASS)
- J-AUTH-REGISTER
- J-AUTH-LOGIN

### Important (SHOULD PASS)
- J-AUTH-LOGOUT

### Future (NOT BLOCKING)
- J-AUTH-2FA
- J-AUTH-PASSWORD-RESET
```

---

## 8. What the LLM Does With This

Given this spec, the LLM:

1. **Parses REQs**:
   - `AUTH-001 (MUST)` → Creates contract rule `AUTH-001` in `docs/contracts/feature_authentication.yml`
   - `AUTH-010 (SHOULD)` → Creates soft rule (guideline, not enforced)

2. **Generates contracts**:
   ```yaml
   rules:
     non_negotiable:
       - id: AUTH-001
         title: "API endpoints require authentication"
         forbidden_patterns:
           - pattern: /router\.(get|post).*\/api\/(?!health|public)/
             message: "Route missing authMiddleware"
   ```

3. **Creates tests**:
   ```typescript
   it('AUTH-001: API routes have authMiddleware', () => {
     // Scan src/routes/ for patterns
     // Fail if violation found
   })
   ```

4. **Generates journey tests**:
   ```typescript
   it('J-AUTH-REGISTER: Complete registration flow', async () => {
     await page.goto('/register')
     // Follow steps 1-10
     expect(page.url()).toContain('/dashboard')
   })
   ```

---

## 9. Writing Tips

### ✅ Good REQs:

```markdown
### EMAIL-001 (MUST)
Email sending MUST be rate-limited to 100 emails/min per user.

### PAY-002 (MUST)
Payment webhooks MUST verify Stripe signatures before processing.

### DATA-003 (MUST)
User data MUST be encrypted at rest using AES-256.
```

**Why good:**
- Specific numbers (100/min, AES-256)
- Clear enforcement criteria
- Observable/testable

---

### ❌ Bad REQs:

```markdown
### SEC-001 (MUST)
The system should be secure.
```

**Why bad:**
- Too vague
- No enforcement criteria
- Not testable

**Fix:**
```markdown
### SEC-001 (MUST)
All API endpoints MUST use HTTPS in production.

### SEC-002 (MUST)
All user inputs MUST be validated before database queries.

### SEC-003 (MUST)
Authentication tokens MUST expire after 7 days.
```

---

## 10. Spec Maintenance

### When to Update:

1. **New feature**: Add new REQs section

2. **Requirement changes**: Update existing REQ, bump contract version

3. **Journey changes**: Update JOURNEYS section

### Version Control:

Add changelog at bottom of spec:

```markdown
---

## Changelog

### 2025-12-02 - v2
- Added AUTH-004: Password hashing requirement
- Updated J-AUTH-REGISTER: Added email confirmation step

### 2025-11-15 - v1
- Initial spec
```

---

## 11. Spec → Contract Mapping

| Spec Element | Contract Element | Test Type |
|--------------|------------------|-----------|
| `ARCH-001 (MUST)` | `feature_architecture.yml: rules.non_negotiable[].id` | Pattern scan |
| `AUTH-001 (MUST)` | `feature_*.yml: rules.non_negotiable[].id` | Pattern scan |
| `AUTH-010 (SHOULD)` | `feature_*.yml: rules.soft[].id` | Guideline |
| `J-AUTH-REGISTER` | `journey_*.yml: journey_meta.id` | E2E test |
| `Critical (MUST PASS)` | `journey_meta.dod_criticality: critical` | Release gate |

**Hierarchy:** Architecture contracts protect structure. Feature contracts protect behavior. Journey contracts verify user flows.
